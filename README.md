Data Collection: Obtain FCD from sources like GPS-equipped vehicles, which transmit data about their location, speed, and sometimes weather conditions.
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the FCD. This may involve filtering out irrelevant data, handling missing values, and standardizing the format.
Extract Relevant Features: Identify which features in the FCD are relevant for road weather forecasting. This could include variables like vehicle speed, location, time of day, and weather conditions.
Weather Data Integration: Integrate weather data from other sources (e.g., weather APIs) to provide additional context. This could include current weather conditions, forecasts, and historical weather patterns.
NLP for Text Data: If there are textual descriptions in the FCD or weather data, you can use NLP techniques to extract valuable information. For example, sentiment analysis might help gauge drivers' reactions to weather conditions, or entity recognition could identify specific weather events mentioned in textual data.
Modeling: Use machine learning or statistical models to predict road weather conditions based on the extracted features. This could involve regression techniques, time series analysis, or more advanced methods like neural networks.
